//Sorting Element of an array by frequency

/*

Example:
Input:
2
5
5 5 4 6 4
5
9 9 9 2 5

Output:
4 4 5 5 6
9 9 9 2 5

Explanation:
Testcase1: The highest frequency here is 2. Both 5 and 4 have that frequency. Now since the frequencies are same then smaller element comes first. So 4 4 comes first then comes 5 5. Finally comes 6.
The output is 4 4 5 5 6.

Testcase2: The highest frequency here is 3. The element 9 has the highest frequency. So 9 9 9 comes first. Now both 2 and 5 have same frequency. So we print smaller element first.
The output is 9 9 9 2 5.
