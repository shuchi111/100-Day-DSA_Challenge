"""
Algorithm:

1. Initialize mod to 10**9 + 7.
2. Initialize prev1 and prev2 to 1.
3. Iterate from 1 to N:
Calculate curr as (prev1 + prev2) % mod.
Update prev2 to the previous value of prev1.
Update prev1 to the current value of curr.
4. Return (prev1 * prev1) % mod, representing the total ways to climb the staircase with N steps.
