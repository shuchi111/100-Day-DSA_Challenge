//Relative Sorting- Sort an array according to the other

/*

Example 1:

Input:
N = 11 
M = 4
A1[] = {2, 1, 2, 5, 7, 1, 9, 3, 6, 8, 8}
A2[] = {2, 1, 8, 3}
Output: 
2 2 1 1 8 8 3 5 6 7 9
Explanation: Array elements of A1[] are
sorted according to A2[]. So 2 comes first
then 1 comes, then comes 8, then finally 3
comes, now we append remaining elements in
sorted order.
