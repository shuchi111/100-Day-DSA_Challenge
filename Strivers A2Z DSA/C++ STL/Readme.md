C++ STL
---
> 1. STL Definition:
STL stands for Standard Template Library.
It is a distinctive feature of C++ that sets it apart from other programming languages.

> 2 . Purpose of STL:
Facilitates the implementation of various data structures with ease.
Reduces the need for developers to write extensive code for common functionalities.

> 3. Contents of STL:
Contains pre-defined templates.
Provides a set of classes and containers.
>4. Ease of Data Structure Implementation:
Enables programmers to implement different data structures effortlessly.
Reduces the complexity associated with coding and managing space-time complexities.
> 4. Container Variety:
Offers a wide range of containers such as vectors, lists, queues, and more.
These containers are ready-made, saving developers from creating them from scratch.
> 5. Template Usage:
Utilizes templates for generic programming.
Allows for the creation of flexible and reusable code.
> 6. Code Reusability:
Promotes code reusability by providing generic implementations.
Developers can easily adapt and reuse these templates for various applications.
> 7. Space-Time Complexity Management:
Developers do not have to worry extensively about space-time complexities.
STL implementations are designed to optimize performance.
